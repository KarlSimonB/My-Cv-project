      <p>
        I am a 29-year-old Web Developer who decided to take on a new chapter in life. 
        Before studying Web Development, I worked for 9 years as a carpenter and also 
        in a factory building pre-fabricated house walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my free-time I enjoy film and music production as well as coding. I aim to incorporate my knowledge in music & film into programming projects & websites.
